# Weather Forecast Project with Web Scraped Data

This project aims to create a weather forecast application using web scraped data and a recursive Lasso model. The main objective is to develop deployment skills while providing a practical foundation for similar tasks.

## üîß Technologies Used

- DVC for version control of datasets and machine learning models.
- Python for backend logic and ML model training.

## üöÄ Quick Start
Step 1: Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/olaaumari/web-scraping-short-forecasting-temperature.git
```
## Step 2: Set up a Python environment:
Using conda, create and activate an environment:


```bash
conda create -n weather-forecast python=3.8 -y
```
```bash
conda activate weather-forecast
```

## Step 3: Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Step 4: Run the DVC pipeline:
```bash
dvc repro
```


# DVC Commands:
Execute these commands if you're making changes or want to track data:
```bash
    dvc init
    dvc repro
    dvc dag
```
